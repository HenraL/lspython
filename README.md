# lspython
An implementation of the "ls" command in Python 

## Installation & Usage
Clone this repo, enter the cloned directory, and run ```pip install -e .``` You should then be able to run this tool system wide by typing ```lspython```, which can be aliased as anything you would like.

## Credit
Most of the code was borrowed from [here](http://www.pixelbeat.org/talks/python/ls.py.html), written by [Pádraig Brady](http://www.pixelbeat.org/), so all credit goes out to him. All I did was use the [prettytable library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PrettyTable) to display the output. I couldn't find his implementation on Github to fork, and I just wanted to get it on here for my own conveninence. Pádraig Brady's Github profile can be found [here](https://github.com/pixelb).
